#### STUDY AID ICONS
In your exercises, you might see one or more of the following icons.

WARNING: If you misconfigure a step marked with this icon, later steps might not work properly. Check the step carefully before you move forward.

IMPORTANT: Review this step or comment carefully to save time, learn a best practice, or avoid errors.

//CAUTION: Caution level message

NOTE: A comment labeled with this icon provides information about the topic or procedure.

TIP: A comment labeled with this icon identifies reference material that provides additional information.


#### CHECKING THE LAB EQUIPMENT
In this exercise, you familiarize yourself with your equipment and ensure that the credentials provided by the instructor are operational.

#### OBJECTIVES
This exercise focuses on enabling you to do the following::
*	 Ensure access to your jump host
*  Ensure connectivity to an ONTAP cluster
*	 Ensure connectivity to the Element Cluster
*	 Test the access to the Linux VMs and verify that all tools are running properly


#### GITHUB CONTAINING ALL THE FILES AND TEMPLATES
You can download or clone the Github public repository containing the necessary files
https://github.com/HaopengL/Automation_DevOps_Using_Jenkins

## Task 1, Ensure Connectivity to your ONTAP
1. Open a browser and visit the following Website:
https://lod-bootcamp.netapp.com
+
NOTE: If you provision the lab by yourself, please use this lab
+
----
Using Trident with Kubernetes and ONTAP v3.1
https://labondemand.netapp.com/lod3/request?catid=SL10556
----

2. At the login prompt, enter the credentials provided to you by your instructor:
+
Login ID: bXXXXu[YOUR KIT]
Password: ask the instructor
+

3. Select the Lab called *Using Trident with Kubernetes and ONTAP* and connect to it.

4. Once you see the Windows Desktop (your jump host), verify that you have a file called *Stateful Cmds.txt* on the Desktop.

5. Make sure your keyboard is set to the correct layout.

6. Open the C:/LOD folder and make sure you see the config folder:
+

7. On the menu bar, click the Putty icon and verify that you can see 6 RHEL hosts
+
image::0_6.png[]

8. In Putty, double click the “cluster1” session and login to the ONTAP cluster:
+
Username: admin
Password: Netapp1!

9. Enter the command “date” and verify that the time is synchronized.

10. Open a web browser and navigate to cluster1.demo.netapp.com.

11. Login using the credentials in step 1-8 and navigate your cluster:
+

## Task 2: Verify That Required Software and Tools Are installed

The RHEL hosts must have several tools running, including Docker and Kubernetes.

1. Open the Putty Client and double click on the *rhel5* session:
+
image::0_8.png[]

2. Login using the credentials:
+
Username: root
Password: Netapp1!

3. Run the following command to verify that the docker daemon is running:
+
----
ps -aef | grep dockerd
----

4. Verify if containers are running:
+
----
docker ps
----

5. Verify the connection to the public Docker repositories:
+
----
docker search netapp
----

6. Run a Docker container and destroy it:
+
----
docker run -it debian
ls -al
exit
docker ps
docker ps -a (to list stopped containers)
docker rm $(docker ps -a -q) (to delete ALL stopped containers)
----

7. Verify that the docker0 interface is configured on the host:
+
----
ifconfig docker0
----

8. Optionally, create an alias for the docker command (makes recurrent commands faster):
+
----
alias d=’docker’
----

9. Close the putty session and open a new one on *rhel3* (master node of the Kubernetes cluster):
+
image::0_9.png[]

10. Login using the credentials:
+
Username: root
Password: Netapp1!

11. Verify that the Kubernetes services are running:
+
----
ps -aux | grep kubernetes
----

12. Optionally, create an alias for the most utilized Kubernetes command:
+
----
alias k=’kubectl’
----
NOTE: If you use the alias, you can replace all the upcoming “kubectl” commands with “k”.

13. Verify the version of Kubernetes:
+
----
k version
----

14. Verify the node type you connected to:
+
----
k cluster-info
----

15. Verify that the Kubernetes cluster is showing you the 3 nodes:
+
----
k get nodes
----
+
Use the -o option to change the output (this option can be used in many commands):
+
----
k get nodes -o wide
k get nodes -o json
----

16. Label the worker nodes (with the role set to “none”) with a recognizable tag:
+
----
k label node rhel1 node-role.kubernetes.io/worker=
k label node rhel2 node-role.kubernetes.io/worker=
----

17. Verify that the Kubernetes nodes are showing the right labels:
+
----
k get nodes
----

18. Open the Kubernetes Configuration Files:
+
----
cat $HOME/.kube/config
----

19. View the Kubernetes Configuration:
+
----
k config view
----

20. Navigate to the root user’s directory:
+
----
cd /root
----

21. Clone the contents of the *Automation DevOps Using Jenkins* git repository and browse the new folder:
+
----
git clone https://github.com/HaopengL/Automation_DevOps_Using_Jenkins
cd Automation_DevOps_Using_Jenkins
ls -al
----
